 Refactor code
 ------------
 Not timed (good to get it back within 24 hours)
 
  Anintern has provided the code below to update the version number
  within two different files.
  The intern has left and you need to review and improve the code before
  submitting to source control.
 
  Please do not be constrained by the existing code (i.e. you don't have
  to keep the same function names, structure)
  Aimfor production quality 'best-practice/clean' code
 
  Original Requirements
 --------------------
 Ascript in a build process needs to update the build version number in 2
  locations.
 - The version number will be in an environment variable "BuildNum"
 - The files to be modified will be under "$SourcePath/develop/global/src"
  directory
 - The "SConstruct" file has a line "point=123," (where 123
  (just an example) should be updated with the value of "BuildNum"
  Environment variable)
 - The "VERSION"file has a line "ADLMSDK_VERSION_POINT= 123" (where 123
  (just an example) should be updated with the value of "BuildNum"
